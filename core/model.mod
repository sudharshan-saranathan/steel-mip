# =====================================================================
# core/model.mod -- the complete steel-decarbonisation model STRUCTURE.
#
# Declares sets, parameters, variables, constraints and the objective.
# Deliberately does NOT choose a solver, does NOT solve, and does NOT
# report. A scenario file layers its parameter overrides on top of this,
# then solves and reports itself.
#
# INVOCATION CONTRACT
#   AMPL resolves `include` against its current working directory, NOT
#   against the file doing the including. Every path below is therefore
#   relative to the REPOSITORY ROOT, and every scenario must be run with
#   the repository root as cwd:
#
#       ampl scenarios/<study>/<scenario>.mod        # from repo root
#
#   In amplpy:  ampl.cd("/path/to/steel")
